# Prolog integration for Vim

Prolog is lacking any sort of functional IDE, besides maybe the Emacs-integration that comes with SWI and Sicstus. Vim has traditionally not been a good editor for Prolog. In fact, it is close to being nothing more than a plain text editor for Proolg.

These files seek to change this. Copy them into your `$VIM_RUNTIME` or just `~/.vim`, preserving the directory structure.

Note that this is very alpha still.
